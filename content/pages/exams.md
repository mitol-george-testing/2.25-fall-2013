There will be two 90-minute quizzes during the term and the dates are announced well in advance. In order to minimize time pressures, we prefer to give the 90-minute quizzes in the evening starting at 7 pm, and give students until 9 pm to complete the problems.

There will be a three hour final exam during the final exam week.

Quizzes and the exam will permit you to use your notes, the course textbook, a calculator, and a book of mathematical formulas and tables. No other books will be allowed. The quizzes and the exam will not present you with routine problems, but will probe for mastery of the underlying material and for skill in modeling problems in the simplest possible realistic terms.
